# UPRISE Infrastructure Policy Check (T5 Implementation)
# Enforces web-tier contract boundaries and deployment policies
#
# This workflow implements the T5 task: Web-Tier Contract Guard with CI Enforcement
# It ensures that apps/web adheres to architectural boundaries defined in:
# - docs/STRATEGY_CRITICAL_INFRA_NOTE.md
# - docs/RUNBOOK.md
# - apps/web/WEB_TIER_BOUNDARY.md
#
# NOTE: This workflow is now integrated into the main CI pipeline (ci.yml)
# It can still be run independently for quick policy checks.
