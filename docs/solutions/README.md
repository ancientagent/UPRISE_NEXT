# Solutions

Playbooks for recurring problems and operational failures (build breaks, deployment misconfigurations, boundary violations, etc.).

## Rule

If an issue happens **twice**, it gets a Solutions doc.

## What goes here

- Root cause writeups that include **symptoms → diagnosis → fix → prevention → verification**
- “Do this first” checklists for common incidents
- Links to relevant runbook sections, specs, and CI checks

## What does not go here

- Feature requirements (use `docs/specs/`)
- Long-form architecture explanations (use `docs/architecture/`)
- Per-session work notes (use `docs/handoff/`)

## Template

Start from: `docs/solutions/TEMPLATE.md`

## Agent Qualification

For new model onboarding and stress-testing, use:
- `docs/solutions/MODEL_ONBOARDING_EVAL.md`
