# UPRISE Canon: Voice & Messaging

**Status:** CANONICAL  
**Purpose:** Defines how to communicate about UPRISE — tone, terminology, positioning, pitches, and audience-specific approaches  
**Audience:** Marketing, communications, sales, founders, anyone speaking about UPRISE

# 1. The UPRISE Voice

## 1.1 Core Voice Attributes

### Convicted but Not Preachy
We believe deeply in what we're building, but we don't lecture. We state our position clearly and let the vision speak for itself. We invite participation rather than demanding agreement.

### Technical but Accessible
We can explain complex architectural concepts, but we always ground them in human experience. We use precise terminology but never jargon for its own sake.

### Urgent but Patient
The problem we're addressing is urgent — the collapse of local music infrastructure has real consequences. But our solution understands that growth happens at the speed of trust. We don't manufacture urgency.

### Critical but Constructive
We diagnose the system's failures clearly, but our focus is on building the alternative, not attacking incumbents. We're creating something new, not waging a war.

### Warm but Direct
We care about the people we're speaking to. We're honest without being harsh. We're helpful without being condescending.

## 1.2 Voice Don'ts

- Don't be preachy or self-righteous
- Don't attack other platforms by name
- Don't promise overnight success
- Don't use hype language ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- Don't apologize for our constraints (friction is intentional)
- Don't oversell or overpromise
- Don't be defensive about limitations

## 1.3 Tone & Voice Constraints

UPRISE language should feel **inevitable, not exciting**:
- Precise, not hype-driven
- Structural, not aspirational
- Clear, not persuasive
- Grounded, not promotional

---

# 2. Tone by Context

| Context | Tone | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Marketing to listeners | Warm, inviting, community-focused | Emphasize connection and discovery |
| Marketing to artists | Empowering, validating, practical | Acknowledge their struggles; offer real value |
| Investor communications | Precise, confident, opportunity-focused | Lead with market insight, not ideology |
| Press communications | Clear, differentiated, stakes-oriented | Focus on what makes us structurally different |
| Internal documentation | Technical, philosophical, rigorous | Full complexity acceptable |
| User support | Patient, helpful, never dismissive | Friction is intentional, but frustration is valid |
| Community communications | Celebratory, participatory | We're building together |

# 3. Terminology & Language Discipline

## 3.1 Avoided Language

The following concepts are intentionally excluded from UPRISE communications:

- Recommendation
- Promotion
- Talent surfacing
- Virality
- Optimization
- Success guarantees
- Quality scoring
- "Revolutionary" / "Game-changing"
- "Democratizing"

## 3.2 Preferred Canonical Language

- Listener-governed broadcast
- Structural locality
- Community-carried propagation
- Procedural fairness
- Infrastructure restoration
- Participation as labor
- Scene-centered discovery
- RaDIYo broadcast network

## 3.3 Key Term Definitions

**The Plot:** The digital habitation and tactical center of the Home Scene. It is the interface where the Community builds the Scene.

**Uprise:** A dual‑state object — the broadcast station/infrastructure operated by a Music Community **and** the Signal of that community broadcast. Like a radio station (e.g., KEXP), it is both the station and the frequency.

**RaDIYo:** Not a playlist or feed. It is the transport system through which listeners move between listening contexts. Toggling tiers does not expand reach — it changes *where you are listening*. You are not served music. You arrive inside Scenes.

---

# 4. Positioning Framework

## 4.1 Foundational Positioning

UPRISE is not here to fix the music industry.

The industry is not broken. It is working exactly as designed — as a highly efficient extraction machine. We do not seek to fix the machine; we seek to obsolete it.

UPRISE exists to **exit** that system by restoring the local broadcast infrastructure that once allowed music to connect people to place, to each other, and to shared reality.

It does not elevate artists.
It does not surface talent.
It does not decide what matters.
It re-establishes the conditions under which communities can.

## 4.2 Revolutionary Positioning Statements

**Primary framing:**
> "UPRISE rebuilds the local broadcast infrastructure that corporate platforms erased."

**Supporting statements:**
> "Music does not need to be optimized. It needs a place to exist."

> "UPRISE is not a platform you browse. It is a system you participate in."

> "Nothing is promoted. Signals propagate when communities carry them."

## 4.3 Positioning Boundaries

**UPRISE is positioned against:**
- Extraction, abstraction, and isolation
- Predictive personalization
- Algorithmic authority

**UPRISE is positioned for:**
- Shared listening
- Local continuity
- Community agency
- Structural fairness

# 5. Core Structural Characteristics

When describing UPRISE, emphasize these structural characteristics (not "features"):

### 1. Universal Local Entry
All music enters at the local level through an artist's verified Home Scene. There is no ranking, no gatekeeping, and no preferential treatment at the point of origin.

### 2. Listener-Governed Propagation
Music is not promoted. It propagates. Songs move from city to state to national listening contexts only when communities sustain them over time. The system prevents shortcuts. It does not accelerate outcomes.

### 3. Fair Play Broadcast Governance (RaDIYo)
RaDIYo enforces equal rotation space and records community action without interpreting it. Engagement affects rotation frequency within a tier. Upvotes are the only signal that allows a song to enter a wider listening context.

### 4. Structural Locality
Critical participation is bound to GPS-verified Home Scenes. Influence cannot be remote, synthetic, or detached from place.

### 5. Direct Presence, Not Parasocial Metrics
Artists and listeners encounter each other inside shared local context. The platform does not mediate relationships or assign value.

### 6. Non-Extractive Revenue Infrastructure
UPRISE supports revenue models that reinforce local ecosystems rather than extracting attention or data. Monetization exists to sustain infrastructure, not to reward manipulation.

# 6. Introduction Paragraph Approaches

## 6.1 Format 1: Industry State + Structural Refusal

For decades, digital platforms promised unlimited access, frictionless discovery, and global reach. What they delivered instead was isolation, abstraction, and the collapse of local music ecosystems. Algorithms replaced shared listening. Geography disappeared. Culture flattened into metrics.

UPRISE refuses this system.

By restoring listener-governed broadcast infrastructure at the local level, UPRISE re-establishes the conditions under which music can once again exist inside community context rather than behavioral feeds. Nothing is optimized. Nothing is accelerated. Music enters locally, remains locally grounded, and only widens when communities sustain it.

## 6.2 Format 2: DIY Lineage Without Outcome Promises

When corporate gatekeepers tightened control in the late twentieth century, artists and listeners built their own infrastructure. Vans replaced labels. Floors replaced hotels. Flyers replaced marketing budgets. Local scenes became distribution networks.

UPRISE is the digital restoration of that pact.

It does not recreate the aesthetics of DIY. It rebuilds its **structure**: local grounding, shared labor, and community-carried propagation. Participation is not a feature. It is the cost of ownership.

## 6.3 Format 3: Community as Context, Not Commodity

Music once lived inside towns, rooms, and shared rituals. Listeners did not consume culture alone. They participated in it together.

UPRISE re-establishes this condition by situating music in place, scene, and collective listening. Discovery is not personalized. It is shared. Disagreement is allowed. Obscurity is acceptable. Nothing is smoothed or averaged for comfort.

---

# 7. Platform Descriptions

## 7.1 Canonical Artist Description

UPRISE provides infrastructure for artists who refuse to perform for algorithms.

Your music enters the system through your Home Scene. It is heard in rotation alongside others, without pre-ranking or preference. What happens next is not decided by the platform. It is determined by sustained, local community action.

UPRISE does not promise growth, reach, or recognition. It promises procedural fairness, structural locality, and protection from extractive manipulation.

## 7.2 Simple Explanation for Newcomers

UPRISE is a listener-governed broadcast platform organized around local music scenes.

Music enters locally. Listeners discover what is present in their community. Songs may move into wider listening contexts only after sustained local continuity.

The platform does not recommend music. It records community participation and enforces structural limits so that influence cannot be bought, predicted, or manufactured.

---

# 8. Elevator Pitches

## 8.1 The 10-Second Pitch

> "UPRISE is community-powered radio that lets local music rise to national awareness through real community support — not algorithms, not pay-to-play."

## 8.2 The 30-Second Pitch

> "The local music ecosystem collapsed. Record shops, radio stations, venue networks — all gone. What replaced them extracts value from artists and isolates listeners in algorithmic bubbles. UPRISE is infrastructure that restores what was lost. At its core is RaDIYo — a listener-governed broadcast network where music travels from local scenes to national awareness only through genuine participation. Artists get free radio-style broadcast distribution. Communities get their frequency back."

## 8.3 The 60-Second Pitch

> "To be an 'independent' artist today, you need to be totally dependent on the platforms that caused the problem. You perform for algorithms. You commodify your personality. You compete in a global void disconnected from any community that could sustain you.
>
> UPRISE is the way out — not by fighting the system, but by building beyond it. We're rebuilding what existed before — the local infrastructure of radio stations, record shops, and venue networks — as a digital broadcast layer.
>
> Music enters at the local level, in your city's Scene. It rises to state and national broadcasts only when your community votes it up. No algorithmic gatekeeping. No pay-to-play. No manufactured virality.
>
> For artists, this is free radio-style broadcast distribution — the power to move from local to national markets based on community support, not platform extraction. For listeners, this is reconnection to the frequency that once held communities together.
>
> UPRISE is not a platform you browse; it's a movement you build."

## 8.4 The Problem-Solution Framework

**The Problem (3 sentences):**
The local music ecosystem has collapsed. Digital platforms promised democratization but delivered extraction — forcing artists to compete in a global void while listeners lost any connection to their local scenes. The result is mass isolation: artists performing for algorithms, listeners trapped in filter bubbles, communities stripped of the shared culture that once held them together.

**The Solution (3 sentences):**
UPRISE restores the infrastructure. At its core is RaDIYo — a listener-governed broadcast network where music travels from local scenes to national awareness through community action, not algorithmic manipulation. Artists get free radio-style broadcast distribution; communities get their frequency back.

# 9. Audience-Specific Messaging

## 9.1 For Artists

### Lead with Value
UPRISE offers what no other platform does: **free radio-style broadcast distribution**. Your music can travel from your city to your state to national audiences — not because an algorithm decided, but because real people in your community voted it up.

### Address Their Pain
You're tired of performing for algorithms. Tired of the content treadmill. Tired of commodifying yourself to sell your music. On existing platforms, you don't own your relationship with your audience — they do.

### Offer the Alternative
UPRISE is different. Your music enters at the local level, in your Home Scene. It rises based on community support, not mysterious metrics. You stay connected to your community even as your reach expands. And you never have to "play the algorithm."

### Key Messages
- "Free radio-style broadcast distribution powered by your community"
- "Let the music speak for itself"
- "No pay-to-play, no algorithmic gatekeeping"
- "Stay rooted in your Scene as your reach grows"
- "Your success stays connected to the community that built it"
- "Three rotation slots to test what resonates"

### What NOT to Promise
- Overnight success
- Guaranteed reach
- Easy fame
- Algorithm-beating tricks

## 9.2 For Listeners

### Lead with Experience
Discover what's actually happening in your local music scene — not what an algorithm thinks you want to hear. UPRISE is community radio for the digital age.

### Address Their Disconnection
When's the last time you discovered an artist from your own city? The platforms that dominate today have no interest in connecting you to your local scene. They optimize for engagement, not community.

### Offer the Connection
UPRISE gives you a front-row seat to your local music ecosystem. Tune in to your city's broadcast. Vote up the music that matters. Watch it rise to state and national awareness because your community carried it there.

### Key Messages
- "Rediscover your local music scene"
- "Community radio for the digital age"
- "Your vote actually matters"
- "No filter bubbles, no algorithmic feeds"
- "Be part of the movement that decides what rises"
- "Experience music the way your Scene experiences it"

### What NOT to Promise
- Personalized recommendations
- "Music you'll love"
- Infinite catalog access
- On-demand everything

## 9.3 For Investors

### Lead with Market Opportunity
The music industry generates $26 billion annually in the US alone — but the value is captured by a handful of gatekeepers. Artists are alienated, listeners are isolated, and local music ecosystems have been systematically dismantled. UPRISE addresses a fundamental structural failure in how music reaches audiences.

### Present the Differentiation
Unlike streaming services that compete on catalog size and recommendation algorithms, UPRISE competes on **community**. Our architecture makes us structurally immune to the winner-take-all dynamics that dominate streaming. Every city is a new market. Every Scene is a new ecosystem.

### Demonstrate Economics
Revenue flows through subscriptions ($5.99 listener discovery / $9.99 artist premium), promotional advertising (artists and local businesses), and (in a later phase, not the initial build) optional paid catalog/label visibility services priced as subscriptions. The circular model returns value to local ecosystems rather than extracting it.

### Key Messages
- "Infrastructure, not just another app"
- "Every city is a new market"
- "Circular economics: value flows back to communities"
- "Structurally differentiated from winner-take-all streaming"

### What NOT to Emphasize
- Competing directly with Spotify (different function)
- Rapid user growth projections (growth at speed of trust)
- "Disrupting" the industry (we're building beyond it)

## 9.4 For Press

### The Hook
Local music infrastructure collapsed. UPRISE is rebuilding it.

### The Angle
This is not another streaming app trying to compete with Spotify. It's a structural alternative — infrastructure that returns control to communities.

### The Stakes
The consequences of algorithmic isolation are real: artist burnout, listener disconnection, communities stripped of shared culture. UPRISE offers a way out.

### Key Messages
- "The anti-algorithm platform"
- "Community radio for the digital age"
- "What if music infrastructure worked for communities instead of against them?"

### Story Angles
- The collapse of local music infrastructure (historical)
- Why GPS verification matters for community integrity
- How a song travels from local to national (the tier system)
- Artists who left the algorithm behind

# 10. Framing Difficult Concepts

## 10.1 "Why GPS Verification?"

**The Reframe:**
GPS verification is not surveillance. It's trust infrastructure.

**The Explanation:**
Voting determines what rises. If votes could come from anywhere — bots, remote actors, bought influence — the system would be meaningless. GPS verification ensures that the people shaping a local Scene are actually *in* that Scene. It's what makes community governance real.

**The Value:**
This is what separates UPRISE from every other platform. Your local scene is actually local. The music rising in your city is being voted up by people who live there. That's the foundation of a high-trust economy.

## 10.2 "Why Can't I Skip to Any Song?"

**The Reframe:**
This is community radio, not on-demand streaming. You're tuning in to a broadcast curated by your community's collective action — not browsing a catalog. The constraint is the feature.

**The Value:**
You experience music the way your Scene experiences it, together. On-demand access optimizes for individual consumption. Broadcast optimizes for shared experience. The magic of discovering music at the same moment as your neighbors is something streaming destroyed. UPRISE restores it.

## 10.3 "What If No One Listens to My Music?"

**The Reframe:**
Obscurity is not a system error. It is the baseline state of a signal that has not yet connected. The platform ensures fairness — your music gets rotation. But we don't manufacture attention or create shortcuts.

**The Alternative Frame:**
On other platforms, "no one listening" might mean the algorithm buried you. Here, it means your community hasn't connected with the music yet. That's honest information. It tells you something real about your work and your Scene.

**Key Point:**
We guarantee fair entry. We don't guarantee success.

## 10.4 "How Is This Different from Spotify/SoundCloud/Bandcamp?"

**The Structural Difference:**
Those platforms optimize for *individual consumption*. They model your behavior, predict your taste, and isolate you in personalized filter bubbles. UPRISE optimizes for *collective experience*. You discover music in shared context with your community. No two listeners have different "For You" pages — everyone in a Scene experiences the same broadcast.

**The Economic Difference:**
Those platforms extract value from local scenes and funnel it upward. UPRISE creates a circular economy where value flows back into local ecosystems through promotions, events, and artist support.

**The Philosophical Difference:**
Those platforms treat music as content to be consumed. UPRISE treats music as a vital resource to be stewarded — rooted in place, renewed through participation.

## 10.5 "Why Is There No Personalized Discovery?"

**The Reframe:**
Personalized discovery isolates you. It creates filter bubbles where you only hear what an algorithm predicts you want. UPRISE believes discovery should be a shared experience — you and your community discovering together.

**The Value:**
When everyone in a Scene experiences the same broadcast, you share context. You can talk about what you heard. You know what your neighbors are hearing. That shared experience is what creates community.

---

# 11. Objection Handling

## 11.1 "This sounds like another algorithm."

**Response:**
The Fair Play Algorithm is not a recommendation engine. It doesn't model behavior, predict taste, or surface content based on what it thinks you want. It enforces structural constraints: equitable rotation, community-driven propagation, and signal integrity. The algorithm is a record-keeper of community action, not its director.

## 11.2 "GPS verification is invasive."

**Response:**
GPS verification serves one purpose: ensuring that votes come from actual community members, not remote actors or bots. We don't track your movements. We verify your presence at the moment of voting to preserve the integrity of local participation. It's the foundation of a high-trust economy.

## 11.3 "What about artists who don't live in a big city?"

**Response:**
Every Home Scene — no matter the size — has equal access to the same tier progression system. A song from a small town can rise to state and national broadcasts just like one from Austin or LA. What matters is community support, not market size.

## 11.4 "How do you prevent gaming the system?"

**Response:**
The architecture makes gaming structurally difficult. GPS verification prevents remote influence. One vote per artist per tier prevents bulk voting. The absence of behavioral prediction means there's no algorithm to hack. In a system driven by genuine participation, artificial signals simply fail to move.

## 11.5 "Why would I use this instead of Spotify?"

**Response:**
Different tools for different purposes. Spotify is a library — you access what you already know you want. UPRISE is a broadcast — you discover what your community is creating right now. We're not replacing on-demand listening; we're restoring community radio.

## 11.6 "Are unknown artists worth hearing?"

**Response (Reframe):**
The question is not whether unknown artists are "worth hearing." The real question is why corporate systems trained listeners to confuse visibility with legitimacy.

UPRISE does not claim that all music is good. It ensures that music is not filtered, buried, or elevated by opaque systems before communities encounter it.

Disagreement is allowed. Rejection is allowed. Obscurity is allowed.
