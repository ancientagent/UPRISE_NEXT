UPRISE Complete Revenue Strategy & Business Ecosystem Architecture
Document Purpose: This document provides comprehensive specifications for ALL revenue models,
business strategies, and economic mechanisms for the UPRISE platform. It serves as the definitive source
for understanding the financial architecture and pricing structures that sustain the UPRISE platform.
Alignment with Canonical Principles: All revenue models are designed to support the circular, anti-extractive
economy outlined in the Identity & Philosophy Canon and Master Narrative Canon. The system does not
predict success or manufacture fame; it provides infrastructure for community-driven growth and ensures
the ecosystem is compensated when value is extracted.
Foundational Position: The platform is infrastructure, not a service; it re-establishes connection, it does not
sell engagement.
Core Economic Philosophy
Circular and Anti-Extractive Model
Every revenue stream is structured to:
Support Local Scenes: Revenue sustains platform infrastructure that serves artists and communities
Maintain Artist Autonomy: Artists retain ownership and control
Prevent Extraction: When value is extracted (e.g., label signings), the ecosystem is compensated
Build Infrastructure: Revenue funds platform development that serves communities
Reject Attention Economy: No revenue from algorithmic manipulation or attention-hacking
Revenue Model Canonical Constraints
All revenue mechanisms in this document are bound by the following non-negotiable constraints:
• No prediction of artist success or audience taste
• No manufacturing, acceleration, or compression of time-to-recognition
• No assignment of cultural legitimacy or value by the platform
• No algorithmic boosting, virality optimization, or pay-for-placement within Fair Play
• No conversion of spending into governance power or visibility advantage
• All analytics remain descriptive, never prescriptive
• Revenue shares tied to optional services must be explicitly contractual and opt-in only
These constraints apply globally to all sections below, whether explicitly restated or not.
Phase 1: Launch Revenue Streams

--- Page 2 ---

Canonical Note (Print Shop): Revenue from Promotions/Offers is Selling Runs (Issuance Capacity) as a
service fee, not selling goods or inventory. See docs/canon/+UPRISE Signal System & Print Shop
Specification.md for the Print Shop model, Runs, and Offer Signals.
Print Shop Revenue Model (Canon-Aligned Clarification)
• The Print Shop does not operate through revenue-share contracts.
• Revenue is generated solely through the purchase of Runs (finite issuance allocations).
• A Run is a paid service that grants the right to mint a defined number of digital artifacts tied to an
Event, Artist, or Signal.
• UPRISE does not handle physical goods, fulfillment, shipping, or inventory.
• UPRISE does not take a percentage of downstream merch sales.
• There is no royalty structure attached to Print Shop issuance.
• Minting occurs internally within UPRISE systems (non-blockchain).
• Print Shop artifacts do not affect Fair Play, visibility, ranking, or governance.
• Print Shop is infrastructure for recording Proof-of-Support and participation — not a marketplace or
resale engine.
• No speculative resale, bidding, or algorithmic promotion mechanisms are attached to Print Shop
artifacts.
On-Air Promotional Ads
Platform Revenue Structure:
• Artists pay either \$5/day or \$20/week to run a 7-10 second ad promoting whatever they want
• Artist-only access creates exclusivity and authenticity
• This creates sponsorship opportunities for local businesses that may want to pay an artist to
promote on the citywide tier
• For artists who reach the state and nationwide tiers, this creates increased visibility within larger
community aggregates. Business participation at this level may be structured around Scene-level
scale metrics rather than individual artist ranking. Exposure of individual artist statistics to
businesses remains an opt-in system decision and is not assumed by default.
• Immediate revenue stream available at launch
The 4th Release Deck Slot (Ad Slot):
• Every artist is allowed up to 3 songs in their Release Deck at a given time (slots 1-3)
• The 4th slot exists within the Artist Management Release Deck interface and is reserved for
recording 10-second promotional ads
• A Release Deck slot determines what may enter the Uprise’s rotation stack; it is not itself a position
within the rotation stack
• This promotional slot does not alter Fair Play ordering, weighting, or tier progression
• This slot will be unlocked through a paid capability gate
• Cost will be determined depending on the frequency and/or range they wish to promote it
Usage:
• Can be used by artists to promote themselves
2

--- Page 3 ---

• Can be sponsored by local businesses paying the artist to use their slot
• Promotes shows, tours, new releases, merchandise, etc.
Promotions Section
Phase 1: Targeted Local Advertising
Platform Revenue Structure:
• Every active music Scene will have a promotions section
• Local businesses, promoters, vendors, etc. can pay to advertise
• The idea is ultimately we would be offering a targeted ad space for every music community of music
for each city
• Even if there only ended up being 5 active music communities in 5 active cities in half of the states,
that’s still something like 625 targeted ad spaces
• That’s just counting the citywide Scenes
• Because of this, we believe we could offer very flexible/affordable cost that would render it a
meaningful service for those who would use it
Advertising Inventory Logic:
• High volume of specific inventory allows UPRISE to offer “very flexible/affordable costs” to local
businesses compared to broad social media advertising
• Each Scene represents a unique, targeted advertising opportunity
• Businesses can reach specific music communities with relevant messaging
Artist Support Through Business Partnerships:
• Provide an advertisement opportunity for local businesses to sponsor a live show
• Businesses pay the artists’ guarantee, taking the pressure off local venues who already have a
difficult enough time paying their own bills
• This directly relieves financial pressure on independent venues
• Strengthens overall local music ecosystem
Phase 2: Dynamic Business Opportunities
• As the platform matures or for certain cities/states with lots of active Scenes
• It may make sense to provide a service in which local businesses could be alerted to promote
specials to take advantage of live music crowds in their area (or something similar)
Phase 2: Subscription Models
Artist Capability Tiers
Structural Rule: Artist Status is an additive Capability activated on a Listener account. It is not a separate
identity. There is only one account type (Listener); Artist is a capability.
3

--- Page 4 ---

Standard Capability (Free):
• 1 Active Slot in Fair Play rotation
• Can purchase Promotional Pack (Flier Promotion Add-On) add-ons for touring ($5 per city),
implemented via the Print Shop Run model and limited strictly to the Promotions surface without
affecting Fair Play or governance
• A Promotional Pack is implemented through the Print Shop Run model but does not function as a
minted artifact in the same way as patches or posters
• Instead, the Run determines the scope and distribution size of a flier promotion across selected
Scene(s), based on the defined print size / cost tier
• Distribution scale (number of Scenes and visibility density within those Promotions surfaces) is
determined by the purchased Run tier
• Visibility is confined strictly to the Promotions surface and does not alter Fair Play, tier progression,
rotation weighting, feed ranking, or governance or rotation
• Can be activated on either Free or Paid Listener accounts
Premium Capability (\$9.99/month):
• 3 Active Slots in Fair Play rotation
• Enhanced Analytics and statistics
• INCLUDES “Discovery Pass” benefits (Full global access to all City/State/National tiers—the “Transport
System”)
• Can purchase Premium statistics add-on for touring (phase 3 or later)
• Can purchase Promotional Pack (Flier Promotion Add-On) add-ons for touring (\$5 per city)
• Can be activated on either Free or Paid Listener accounts
• Note: Premium Capability includes Discovery Pass; user does not need a separate Discovery Pass
subscription
Listener Accounts & Discovery Pass
Free Listener Account:
• Access to city, state, and nationwide tiers of Home Scene only
• Access to mix market - phase 2 (no access to “discover” section)
• Can activate Standard Artist Capability (1 slot) without additional cost
Discovery Pass (\$5.99/month):
• Definition: Unlocks global access to all City/State/National tiers across all Scenes (the “Transport
System”)
• User can explore any music community in any city/state nationwide
• Can only vote in registered Home Scene
• Can modify account to “Ambassador” - phase 2 (allows user to flag themselves as a provider of
services for artists on tour)
• Clarification: A user can hold a Discovery Pass (\$5.99) and Standard Artist Capability (Free)
simultaneously. These are independent; Discovery Pass unlocks transport, Artist Capability adds
rotation slots.

Upgrade Options:
• Can Upgrade to “mixologist” - phase 2
• Making account total \$9.99 (\$5.99 base + \$4 upgrade)
• Mixologist feature allows creation and sale of curated playlists
VIP Club Membership (V2 – Price TBD)
Model:
• Artists who want to make extra money a month opt into the VIP program
• Listeners get to select a couple of their favorite local artists who are enrolled in the VIP program
• Artist will provide VIP perks and opportunities for VIP fans in the program like:
• Afterparty invites
• Access to backstage greenroom
• Access to special material, etc.
• The more VIP listeners a VIP artist has, the more money they make a month
Purpose:
• Direct artist-to-fan monetization tool
• Strengthens artist-fan relationships
• Provides additional revenue stream for artists
• Maintains local connection even as artists grow
Phase 3+: Advanced Revenue Models
Artist Catalog & Analytics Service for Studios/Labels
The Problem: Artist Invisibility
Most artists do not even have a way of being heard within their own city. The primary mechanism available
to them is playing live shows. Forty years ago, this worked — everywhere was considered a venue, bands
could play somewhere new seven nights a week, sell records, tapes, CDs, and merch every night, save
enough cash, and build that into a tour. But that infrastructure no longer exists. The live music ecosystem
has contracted dramatically, and the culture around it has changed with it. That was a time when listeners
knew that if they wanted to discover new music, they had to go out and find it. Even if that mentality still
existed, artists no longer have music to sell — because it is all free online. Today, the only way an artist can
get new fans is if those people happen to be at whatever bar they are playing at. There is no infrastructure
that connects an artist to the broader music community in their own city, let alone to fans in other cities or
at a national level.
This is the baseline reality for the vast majority of independent artists. They are not struggling to break
through a ceiling — they are struggling to be heard at all.
Meanwhile, platforms like Spotify have conditioned artists to give away their entire music library to the
public just for the chance of being heard. Artists surrender their catalog, receive fractions of a cent per
stream, and most remain just as invisible as they were before — except now their music is devalued.

--- Page 6 ---

How UPRISE Changes This
UPRISE solves artist invisibility — starting at the local level and scaling outward.
At the city tier, artists enter their Home Scene’s Fair Play rotation and are heard by the local music
community in their genre — not just the 30 people who happened to show up to a Tuesday night gig, but
the actual community of listeners in their city who care about that genre of music. This alone is a
fundamental shift. For the first time, an artist has a mechanism to reach their local audience that does not
depend on booking shows. And it makes those shows count for a lot more — people are going because they
have new favorite songs they want to hear live, which makes them want to buy merch, bring friends, and
sell out buildings that are used to having 20 people at most.
From there, the platform’s tiered broadcast structure — city, state, and nationwide — creates a path for
artists to expand their visibility organically, driven entirely by real fans voting in real communities. The
RaDIYo broadcast network creates national rotations for each genre of music — the most popular songs in
the country, in their genre, voted on by fans of that genre. Not curated by editors. Not ranked by
algorithms. Not promoted by labels. Validated by the people who actually listen to and care about the
music.
Every day, artists who never had a shot at being heard — even in their own city — are expanding their
reach.
Artists achieve this visibility without surrendering their entire music library to the public. Artists control how
much of their catalog is exposed. The platform’s Fair Play system manages rotation slots, not open-access
streaming libraries. Artists are heard on their terms.
And critically, UPRISE generates comprehensive statistical data on every artist participating in the platform
— community engagement metrics, geographic spread patterns, tour performance, growth trajectories,
cross-Scene resonance, and more. This data is derived entirely from real community activity. It cannot be
faked, bought, or algorithmically inflated.
This means that for the first time, artists know their worth. They have data that reflects what their
community actually thinks of their music, how far it has traveled, and how sustainably their career is
growing. If an artist chooses to pursue a label deal, they walk into that negotiation with the data to
advocate for themselves — they know exactly what their community support looks like, how far their music
has traveled, and what they bring to the table.
The Catalog Service
Not every artist on UPRISE dreams of signing a record deal. Some do. Some want to remain independent
and build sustainable careers within their communities. The platform serves both paths equally.
For artists who do want to pursue the label path, UPRISE offers a **catalog feature** they can opt into.
It exists solely as a discovery surface for labels — not as a platform‑driven promotion tool.
And for UPRISE, this is a way to generate revenue from the entities that have historically taken from
independent music ecosystems without giving anything back. Labels have always extracted talent from
local scenes. This service ensures that if they want access to UPRISE’s artists and data, they pay for it.

--- Page 7 ---

The platform does not push artists to labels, predict who will become successful, or manufacture visibility. It
provides a catalog of **opted‑in** artists for label review with Ecosystem Health & Career Sustainability Analysis — and labels
do their own review and due diligence.
Artist Opt-In: Artists choose whether to be listed in the catalog. Participation is voluntary, and artists can opt
out at any time. No artist is surfaced to labels without their explicit consent.
Ecosystem Health & Career Sustainability Analysis:
The analysis framework includes four dimensions, all derived from real community activity:
Community Resonance Metrics:
How well an artist’s music resonates within their Home Scene
Cross-Scene organic spread patterns
Geographic engagement distribution
Community validation through actual votes and engagement
Career Sustainability Indicators:
Long-term engagement patterns (not viral spikes)
Consistent growth trajectories
Community relationship depth
Tour performance and audience development
Cross-Scene cultural fit
Ecosystem Health Assessment:
Artist’s contribution to Scene health
Community investment in artist’s success
Local infrastructure support (venues, promoters, fans)
Sustainable growth patterns (not manufactured virality)
Risk Mitigation Data:
7

--- Page 8 ---

Actual community engagement vs. algorithmic manipulation
Geographic spread patterns (organic vs. paid)
Long-term sustainability indicators
Community relationship strength
Artist Empowerment
UPRISE restructures the negotiation dynamic between artists and labels by ensuring artists possess
verifiable, community-derived data about their reach, growth, and support before entering any external
agreement. Participation in the catalog is voluntary. Artists retain full control of their catalog and may opt in
or out at any time. Pursuing a label relationship is optional, not structurally required for visibility.
Revenue Structure
Only opted-in artists are listed in the catalog; labels review performance stats and community signals
directly (no platform pushing)
Labels pay a premium subscription to access the catalog and its data
If an artist voluntarily enrolls in the label visibility service and later signs a label agreement, the predefined
contractual revenue share applies according to the signed service terms
Strategic Benefits
For Artists:
• Community-derived visibility without surrendering catalog control
• Access to descriptive performance data reflecting real engagement
• Optional participation in external label pathways
• Full opt-in/opt-out autonomy
For Labels:
• Access to a catalog of community-validated artists with comprehensive engagement data
• Performance metrics based on real community actions, not manufactured signals
• Data that reflects sustainable growth patterns, reducing signing risk
For the UPRISE Ecosystem:
• Contractual revenue shares tied to optional services support platform sustainability when those
services are used
8

--- Page 9 ---

• Infrastructure Reciprocity, when triggered by an opted-in artist who has enrolled in the label visibility
service and subsequently signs a label agreement, contributes to platform sustainability according
to predefined percentage terms
• Demonstrates that regenerative infrastructure can engage with the traditional industry without
being consumed by it
Implementation Considerations
Studio/Label Side:
• Market analysis of how many labels might subscribe
• Competitive analysis of similar services (if any exist)
• Subscription tier pricing structure
• Industry standard percentages for comparable services
Artist Side:
• Average size of record deals for emerging artists
• Fair revenue share percentage for optional label visibility service that does not discourage artist
participation
• Competitive analysis of traditional A&R fees and management cuts
• Value proposition of data-backed negotiating power
• Opt-out mechanism design and artist autonomy protections
UPRISE Platform:
• Costs of implementing and maintaining the catalog service
• Required return to sustain the service
• Projected revenue scenarios at different adoption rates
• Risk analysis and mitigation strategies
• Ongoing alignment with anti-extractive principles
PRO Alternative for Businesses
Business Problem:
• PROs (Performing Rights Organizations) collect money for signed artists
• Unsigned artists don’t have anyone to do this
• A lot of businesses, primarily retail, can’t afford to play popular music, radio, even jukeboxes in their
establishments
• PROs will hunt them down and try to sue them if they play music without paying them a monthly fee
UPRISE’s Solution: Offer a business subscription that licenses access to selected Scene broadcasts.
Subscription fees are allocated to participating artists according to predefined distribution rules.
Subscription Options:
• They could choose from a 1, 2, or 3 channel subscription
9

--- Page 10 ---

• Would be good for 3 different local music communities of their choice
• Access to both the statewide and nationwide tiers as well
Revenue Distribution Framework (TBD):
• Allocation model must be rule-based and auditable
• Must not confer visibility, ranking, or governance advantage
• Must remain descriptive, not prescriptive
• Exact weighting (local priority, play-based allocation, or hybrid) to be finalized and documented prior
to launch
Allocation Models Under Consideration (Non-Final):
• Play-based distribution (requires verified reporting)
• Local-priority weighting
• Hybrid allocation combining verified plays and tier context
Benefits:
• Businesses get affordable, legal, locally relevant music
• Subscription revenue is distributed to participating artists according to defined allocation rules
• Supports local music infrastructure
• Provides legal alternative to PRO fees
Premium Venue Analytics and Career Sustainability Services
Core Offering: As the platform matures and has had time to measure the many aspects of the independent
music industry, UPRISE will be able to provide valuable insights to help not only artists and listeners but
bookers, promoters, and venue owners as well.
Critical Reframing: These are NOT “prediction services” that manufacture outcomes. Instead, they provide
Career Sustainability Analysis based on actual historical data and community engagement patterns.
Venue Analytics Features:
• Revenue Estimation Based on Historical Data: Venue owners can input a potential 3-band lineup and
receive a revenue estimation based on historical data from similar lineups, actual attendance
patterns, and community engagement metrics
• Private Review Network: Venue owners can add notes/reviews on band profiles that would only be
available for other venue owners to read
• Premium Statistical Data and Insights: Based on actual performance data, not predictions
Artist Analytics Features:
• Most Sustainable Tour Routes: Based on actual historical data showing where artists have found
success, community engagement patterns, and venue relationships
• Artist-Venue Review System: Artists could leave reviews/notes on certain venues which only other
artists would be able to read regarding tour routes and payouts
10

--- Page 11 ---

• Series of Premium Features: Based on years of data tracking potentially every band in every city, in
every state in the country
• NOTE: In the artist case, this could be included as an add-on package to their premium or “pro”
account subscription
Big Picture B2B Models
Data as Strategic Asset
Once we have established a large “catalogue” of artists, after years and years of collecting statistical data
from every aspect/movement within the entire countrywide independent music industry:
Data Collected:
• Trends (actual community-driven trends, not manufactured)
• Billboard tops (community-validated)
• Best tour routes (based on actual success)
• Average turnouts (historical data)
• Payouts (actual venue data)
• Attendance (real numbers)
• And much more (need to spend time covering data sets to track from day one)
Critical Principle: This data represents actual community actions and engagement patterns, not algorithmic
predictions or manufactured outcomes. The value is in the authenticity and comprehensiveness of the data,
not in predictive capabilities.
Use Cases:
• Industry analysis and reporting
• Market research for independent music
• Academic research on music communities
• Policy development for music infrastructure

tool (opt-in only)
Mix Market for discovery and purchase of playlists
Conclusion: Revenue as Restoration Infrastructure
UPRISE’s revenue model is not designed to extract value from artists or communities. Instead, it creates a
circular economy where:
Infrastructure Sustainability: Revenue sustains platform operations and defined compensation mechanisms
Infrastructure is Funded: Platform development serves communities
Ecosystem is Protected: Participation remains opt‑in and community‑validated
Contractual Revenue Shares: When optional services tied to label visibility result in a signing, predefined
revenue-share terms apply
Foundational Position: The platform is infrastructure, not a service; it re-establishes connection, it does not
sell engagement.
“UPRISE is not a platform you browse; it is a movement you build.”
This extends to the revenue model: UPRISE is not a platform that extracts value; it is an infrastructure that
restores and sustains local music ecosystems.
