UPRISE Glossary — Canon Audit (Working)
Purpose This document is a line-by-line audit of the uploaded Glossary against the Master Narrative
Canon.
Rules of this audit - The Master Narrative Canon is the sole governing authority. - No new mechanics,
hierarchies, or terms may be introduced. - Canon language (e.g., Scene, Community, Home Scene, Uprise) is
preserved unless it directly contradicts the Canon. - This audit corrects drift, legacy phrasing, and category
errors only.
Audit Status
• ❗ This is an audit, not a rewrite.
• ❗ Items are marked as OK, CONSTRAIN, or REMOVE / REPLACE.
• ❗ Proposed changes are minimal and Canon-anchored.
1. Platform Identity Terms
UPRISE (proper noun)
Status: OK
Canon Alignment: Matches the Master Narrative Canon framing of UPRISE as infrastructure. Movement
framing is acceptable as descriptive, not mechanical.
Action: None
Uprise
Status: CONSTRAIN (terminology clarification only)
Canon Truth: An Uprise is the broadcast station operated by a Music Community within a Scene.
Audit Note: The Glossary currently labels Uprise as a "signal". This is a category error relative to the Canon,
where: - Signals are carried units (songs, events, projects) - Uprise is the broadcast output of a Scene
Required Correction (minimal): - Remove the word "signal" from the term header - Preserve all broadcast
language
Approved Canon Definition:
1

--- Page 2 ---

Uprise — The broadcast station operated by a Music Community within a Scene. The audible
output of a Scene carried by the RaDIYo network. An Uprise is not a playlist and not a Signal.
2. Structural Terms
Scene
Status: OK
Canon Alignment: Matches the Master Narrative Canon definition: - Place-bound container - Exists at
Citywide, Statewide, Nationwide levels - Infrastructure lives at Citywide only
Action: None
Home Scene
Status: OK (dual-definition per Canon)
Canonical Definition: A user’s local music Scene of choice.
Extended Canon Context: The Home Scene is also the civic anchor in which a user "lives" on the platform.
It is the Scene where: - Voting eligibility is determined - Civic actions occur - Community participation is
situated
This dual definition is intentional: one phrase captures user choice and locality; the other captures civic
anchoring. Both are true and non-conflicting.
Community
Status: OK
Canon Alignment: Correctly defined as people, distinct from Scene.
Action: None
Sect
Status: OK (minor constraint already implied in Canon)
2

--- Page 3 ---

Canon Alignment: Sects are sub-communities within a Home Scene and may operate their own broadcast
only after meeting thresholds.
Action: None
Music Community
Status: OK
Canon Alignment: Consistent with Canon usage: people + shared musical practice, not a platform category.
Action: None
Audit Notes (Important)
• Parent Genre / Child Genre language is legacy and does not exist in the Master Narrative Canon.
• The Canon uses Scene and Community as the authoritative structural terms.
• Any taxonomy language must be treated as descriptive only or removed if it implies hierarchy.
These will be addressed explicitly when we reach those entries later in the Glossary.
Audit in progress. No Canon changes made in this pass.
3. Interface & Broadcast Terms (PASS 2)
The Plot
Status: OK
Canonical Definition: The Plot; the dashboard in which listeners interact with their community within their
Home Scene.
Canon Alignment: Matches Master Narrative Canon. The Plot is a civic interface, not a personalized feed.
Activity Feed (S.E.E.D Feed), Events, Promotions, Statistics/Scene Map, and Social (V2) are correctly scoped.
Constraint Reminder: - The Plot does not rank, recommend, or personalize content.
Action: None
3

--- Page 4 ---

Activity Feed (S.E.E.D Feed)
Status: CONSTRAIN
Canonical Definition: The default surface of The Plot; the activity feed is the primary dashboard view
presented when a user enters their Home Scene.
S.E.E.D stands for Support, Explore, Engage, Distribute.
Canonical Constraint:
The Activity Feed reflects explicit community actions only (Blasts, registrations, releases). It is
identical for all users in a Home Scene and never ranked, scored, or personalized.
Clarification: - The Activity Feed is the default tab of The Plot. - All other Plot surfaces (Events, Promotions,
Statistics/Scene Map, Social) are accessed from it.
Action: Constraint and default-surface relationship made explicit.
Issue: The term implies algorithmic surfacing or optimization.
Canonical Resolution: - Replace with Activity Feed (descriptive) language. - If retained as phrasing, it
must be explicitly defined as non-algorithmic descriptive labeling only.
Action: Recommend removal or strict constraint note.
RaDIYo
Status: OK (definition clarified)
Canonical Definition: RaDIYo; the broadcast type and delivery technology used by UPRISE, analogous to
radio.
It is the listener-governed broadcast infrastructure that carries Uprises (Scene broadcasts) across tiers.
Canon Alignment: RaDIYo defines how music is transmitted (broadcast), not what is selected or who it is for.
It is not a playlist, not a recommendation system, and not a discovery algorithm.
Action: Definition clarified to emphasize broadcast technology analogy.
RaDIYo Player
Status: CONSTRAIN
4

--- Page 5 ---

Issue: Discovery wording may be misread as recommendation.
Canonical Constraint:
The RaDIYo Player enables tuning and traversal only. Discovery occurs solely through user-
initiated actions.
Action: Add explicit constraint sentence.
Tier System (Citywide / Statewide / National)
Status: OK (explicit definition added)
Canonical Definition: The Tier System is the broadcast stratification framework used by UPRISE to organize
how music moves from local Scenes to broader awareness.
It consists of three broadcast tiers: - Citywide — the only tier that represents an actual community and
contains civic infrastructure. - Statewide — an aggregate broadcast composed of top-performing Citywide
Uprises within a state. - National — an aggregate broadcast composed of top-performing Statewide
Uprises.
Canonical Constraints: - Only Citywide tiers represent communities. - Statewide and National tiers are
aggregate-only and contain no civic authority. - Voting is enabled only at Citywide and Statewide tiers. -
National tier is non-interactive and absolute.
Action: Added explicit definition; no structural change.
Listener
Status: OK
Canon Alignment: Every user is a Listener; civic power only via Home Scene affiliation.
Action: None
Visitor
Status: OK (canonical term)
Canonical Definition: A user present in a Scene that is not their Home Scene.
Capabilities: - Listen - ADD - FOLLOW - BLAST - SKIP - REPORT
5

--- Page 6 ---

Restrictions: - No voting - No civic actions - No influence over Fair Play
Canon Note: "Visitor" is the only valid term. The term "Observer" is deprecated and must not appear in any
Canon-aligned document.
Action: Canon term confirmed; legacy usage removed.
Locally Affiliated
Status: CONSTRAIN (clarified per Canon)
Canonical Definition: A Listener who has selected a Home Scene and is civically anchored to that Scene.
Clarification (Important): - A Listener may select a Home Scene without providing GPS verification. -
Refusing GPS verification does not remove the Home Scene or any non-civic capabilities. - GPS verification
affects voting only.
Capabilities (with or without GPS): - Listen - ADD - FOLLOW - BLAST - SKIP - REPORT - Participate socially
and culturally within the Home Scene
Additional Capability (GPS verified only): - UPVOTE (civic voting)
Canon Constraint: Voting is the only action gated by GPS verification. All other participation remains
available.
Action: Definition constrained to separate Home Scene selection from voting eligibility.
PASS 2 complete. No Canon mechanics altered; terminology constrained to prevent drift.
4. Action, Voting, Engagement & Fair Play Terms (PASS 3)
ADD
Status: CONSTRAIN (corrected per Canon)
Canonical Definition: A private action that saves a Signal to a Listener’s personal collection and may
contribute to engagement weighting where defined.
Canonical Clarification: - ADD is a form of explicit, intentional listener engagement. - ADD may contribute
to Engagement Score (rotation frequency) where specified by Fair Play rules. - ADD does not affect tier
progression (UPVOTE only). - ADD does not assign legitimacy or civic authority.
6

--- Page 7 ---

Canon Constraint: ADD influences rotation weighting only through additive engagement. It never
suppresses, penalizes, or advances a song across tiers.
Action: Definition corrected to reflect engagement contribution without authority drift.
BLAST
Status: CONSTRAIN
Canonical Definition: A public action that expresses support for a Signal within the Listener’s Home Scene.
Canonical Behavior: - BLASTs appear as a public channel within the Activity Feed. - BLASTs are visible to
all Listeners in the Home Scene.
Canon Constraints: - BLAST reflects explicit community action only. - BLAST may contribute to Activity
Points where defined. - BLAST does not influence tier progression and does not assign legitimacy or civic
authority.
Action: Clarified visibility as a public Activity Feed channel; no authority implications added.
UPVOTE
Status: OK
Canonical Definition: A civic voting action that contributes to a song’s eligibility for tier progression.
Canon Constraints: - UPVOTE is available only to Locally Affiliated Listeners who are GPS verified. - Voting
occurs during playback. - A Listener may vote for multiple songs, but only once per song per tier. - UPVOTE
affects tier progression only and never affects rotation frequency.
Action: None
SKIP
Status: CONSTRAIN (aligned to Fair Play Canon)
Canonical Definition: An action that advances playback forward in the broadcast rotation.
Canonical Behavior: - SKIP advances the Listener to the next item in the broadcast rotation. - SKIP does not
mute, pause, or replace the broadcast with alternative content.
Canon Constraints: - SKIP is not a negative signal. - SKIP contributes no engagement value for that
encounter. - SKIP does not suppress, penalize, or demote a song. - SKIP does not affect tier progression.
7

--- Page 8 ---

Canon Rationale: SKIP represents listener traversal through the broadcast, not rejection. Absence of
engagement is recorded; no inference is made.
Action: Definition updated to reflect forward traversal behavior and additive-only engagement rules.
REPORT
Status: OK
Canonical Definition: A moderation action used to flag content for review.
Canon Constraints: - REPORT does not affect Fair Play, engagement, or tiering. - REPORT exists solely for
moderation and safety workflows.
Action: None
Engagement Score
Status: OK
Canonical Definition: A per-song metric derived from additive listener engagement that influences
rotation frequency after the initial exposure window.
Canon Constraints: - Engagement is additive-only. - Absence of engagement is not interpreted. -
Engagement Score never affects tier progression.
Action: None
Fair Play
Status: OK (engagement rules incorporated)
Canonical Definition: The listener-governed broadcast governance system that ensures equal opportunity
at entry and community-determined outcomes over time.
Core Properties: - Equal exposure at entry. - No personalization or prediction. - No platform discretion over
outcomes. - Separation of rotation frequency (engagement) and tier progression (UPVOTE).
Engagement Rules (Song-Level)
Engagement for songs is calculated using a fixed, additive point system. Points are awarded per listener
encounter and influence rotation frequency only.
8

--- Page 9 ---

Point Allocation: - 3 points — Full song completion - 2 points — Majority listen (more than half of song
duration) - 1 point — Partial listen (at least one-third of song duration) - 0 points — Skip or early traversal
before one-third completion
Engagement Constraints: - Engagement is additive-only. - Absence of engagement is not interpreted. - No
action subtracts points. - Engagement points never affect tier progression.
Phases: - Initial Exposure Window: standardized rotation independent of engagement. - Engagement-
Weighted Rotation: rotation frequency reflects accumulated engagement points.
Action: Engagement point system explicitly incorporated into Fair Play.
PASS 3 complete. No Canon mechanics introduced; action semantics aligned to Master Narrative Canon.
5. Subscriptions & Access (PASS 4)
Discovery Pass
Status: OK
Canonical Definition: A subscription that expands a Listener’s ability to access broadcast tiers and Scenes
beyond their Home Scene.
Canonical Scope: - Grants listening access to Citywide, Statewide, and National tiers across all Scenes. -
Enables traversal and discovery only.
Canon Constraints: - Discovery Pass does not grant voting rights outside the Home Scene. - Discovery Pass
does not confer civic authority, legitimacy, or influence. - All governance remains bound to the Listener’s
Home Scene.
Action: None
Play Pass
Status: OK
Canonical Definition: A subscription associated with an Artist Account that expands upload and
management capacity.
Canonical Scope: - Increases the number of active song slots available in the Play Deck. - May include
additional analytics or tooling related to artist management.
9

--- Page 10 ---

Canon Constraints: - Play Pass does not affect Fair Play rotation or tier progression. - Play Pass does not
purchase visibility, placement, or legitimacy. - All songs enter Fair Play under identical rules regardless of
subscription.
Action: None
Subscription Boundary Principle
Status: OK
Canonical Rule: Subscriptions in UPRISE may expand access or capacity only.
They must never: - Alter governance rules - Modify Fair Play behavior - Influence ranking, rotation, or tiering
- Create economic shortcuts to legitimacy
Action: Boundary principle made explicit for spec safety.
PASS 4 complete. Subscriptions constrained to access and capacity only; no authority or influence introduced.
6. Signals, Print Shop & Proof-of-Support (PASS 5)
Signal
Status: OK
Canonical Definition: A discrete unit of meaning that can be created, carried, and acknowledged through
explicit community action.
Canonical Scope: - Signals may be Songs, Events, Projects, Promotions, or Proof-of-Support artifacts. -
Signals are acted upon by Listeners (ADD, BLAST, SUPPORT where applicable).
Canon Constraints: - Signals never carry civic authority. - Signal visibility does not imply legitimacy. -
Accumulation of Signals must never translate into governance power.
Action: None
Print Shop
Status: CONSTRAIN (digital-only issuance clarified)
10

--- Page 11 ---

Canonical Definition: An infrastructure surface that enables the minting and issuance of limited-run
digital artifacts tied to Events, Artists, or Projects.
Canonical Scope: - The Print Shop exists within the Events surface. - It issues digital swag and
promotional items specifically representing: - Show posters - Band or single artwork - Shirts, patches, and
flyers (digital wearables / profile items) - Limited-run promotional gear tied to Events, Artists, or releases. -
Issued items can be collected by users and displayed on profiles or avatars. - Items are minted within
UPRISE systems and are not blockchain-based.
Canon Constraints: - The Print Shop is not a marketplace. - No physical artifacts are issued. - No
blockchain, NFTs, or external ledgers are used. - No resale, bidding, or speculative mechanics. - No
algorithmic promotion, ranking, or optimization of items. - Issuance does not affect Fair Play, engagement,
or tiering.
Action: Non-blockchain minting explicitly locked.
Run
Status: OK
Canonical Definition: A finite issuance allocation created through the Print Shop.
Canonical Scope: - A Run produces a fixed number of unique artifacts. - Once exhausted, a Run cannot be
replenished.
Canon Constraints: - Runs cannot be inflated post-creation. - Runs do not convey authority or priority.
Action: None
Proof-of-Support
Status: OK
Canonical Definition: A verification mechanism that records off-platform support or participation as an on-
platform Signal.
Canonical Scope: - Proof-of-Support may be generated from Event attendance, donations, or other verified
actions. - Proof-of-Support may contribute to Activity Points where defined.
Canon Constraints: - Proof-of-Support does not affect Fair Play rotation or tier progression. - Proof-of-
Support does not create visibility or legitimacy shortcuts.
Action: None
11

--- Page 12 ---

PASS 5 complete. Signals and economic surfaces constrained to descriptive and participatory roles only; no
authority leakage introduced.
