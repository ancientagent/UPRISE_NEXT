# Sprint 0 Plan — Alignment + MVP Definition

**Goal:** Translate canon + specs into an implementable MVP slice and lock the minimum decisions required to start building.

## Objectives
- Lock key canon‑blocked decisions needed for the MVP slice.
- Confirm the MVP flow and scope.
- Produce an implementation checklist (models → APIs → UI → tests).

## MVP Slice (Target)
- Onboarding → Home Scene selection
- RaDIYo playback (non‑personalized)
- Fair Play rotation skeleton

## Canon Inputs (Source of Truth)
- `docs/canon/` (all canon)
- `docs/specs/` (product specs)
- `docs/specs/DECISIONS_REQUIRED.md` (blocked items)

## Decisions to Lock (Sprint 0)
1. **Fair Play timing**
   - Initial exposure window duration
   - Re‑evaluation cadence
2. **Thresholds**
   - Sect Uprise activation threshold
   - City → State → National propagation thresholds
3. **Activity Points (minimum viable)**
   - Points table for participation (if needed for MVP UI)

## Deliverables
- Decision log entries in `docs/specs/DECISIONS_REQUIRED.md`
- MVP scope confirmation doc (this plan)
- Implementation checklist ready for Sprint 1

## Risks
- Unlocked thresholds may stall Fair Play design.
- Canon ambiguities in “WORKING/UNDECIDED” sections.

## Exit Criteria
- MVP scope is signed off.
- Minimum decisions locked or explicitly deferred.
- Sprint 1 plan approved.
