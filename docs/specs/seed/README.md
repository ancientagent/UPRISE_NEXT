# Seed Data (Implementation Support)

This folder contains **implementation seed data** used for onboarding and routing. It is **not canon** and must never override `docs/canon/` semantics.

## Contents
- `music-communities.json` — Launch-ready Music Community list (parent scenes).
- `taste-tag-map.json` — Mapping of taste tags to parent Music Communities (routing only).
- `music-community-taxonomy.md` — Internal taxonomy reference (not user-facing).

## Rules
- These lists are **internal** and not user-facing taxonomies.
- Tags are used for routing and Scene Map clustering only.
- Do not introduce new structural terms here; use canon vocabulary in specs.
