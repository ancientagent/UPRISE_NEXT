Total Parent Communities: 12

This set is minimal because each Parent Community corresponds to real-world scene infrastructure that reliably exists at the local level: distinct venue circuits, DIY networks, dance ecosystems, religious/community institutions, diaspora organizations, and/or specialist subcultures with strong lineage rules. Collapsing any of these parents causes predictable governance failure: misrouting new users, flattening culturally distinct lineages, and forcing communities to fight the default system just to be accurately represented.

Edge cases that may justify a motion to create a new Parent category:
- Religious/devotional ecosystems that function as independent infrastructure beyond Gospel/Qawwali/etc.
- Dedicated children/family music scenes (rare but structurally distinct in some cities)
- Scene-specific movement containers that behave like parents across genres
- Regionally dominant traditions where one lineage behaves as a city’s primary organizing axis
