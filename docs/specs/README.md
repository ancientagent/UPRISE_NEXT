# Specs

Feature and system specifications, organized by module. Specs are the source of truth for behavior, contracts, and acceptance criteria.

## Structure
- [`communities/`](./communities/README.md) — Community + geo features (PostGIS, verification, discovery).
- [`users/`](./users/README.md) — Auth, onboarding, roles, profiles.
- [`system/`](./system/README.md) — Cross-cutting concerns (logging, analytics, CI/CD, observability).

## Templates
- [`TEMPLATE.md`](./TEMPLATE.md) — Standard spec template (copy to start a new spec).

## Legacy Specs Index
- [`docs/Specifications/README.md`](../Specifications/README.md) — Existing index and canonical IDs used elsewhere in the repo; keep in sync until migration is complete.
